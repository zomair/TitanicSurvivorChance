Before running titanic, please run the top cell (only once), it will generate titanic data.
For Spam, change the dataset = 'spam' (line 247), otherwise change it to 'titanic '(line 247).

For decision tree, change classifier type to Tree (line 250) and turn Bagging 'Off' (line 248), otherwise change it to 'Forest' (line 250) and turn Bagging 'On' (Line 248).

Bagsize can be chosen at line 342.

Tree depth can be chosen at line 311 and 315 (for decision tree) and line 345 and 349(forest).

Visual representation can be turned on at line 200 (by uncommenting it).

The titanic data needs to be in home\datasets\titanic, and spam at home\datasets\spam-dataset.
